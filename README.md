# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection

### Goal of this Project

<p> 
The primary goal of plant leaf disease detection is to aid in the early and accurate identification of diseases and pest infestations in plants. By detecting these issues farmers and gardeners can take appropriate measures to mitigate the spread of disease, minimize crop losses, and optimize yields. Ultimately, the aim is to improve crop health, increase agricultural productivity, and contribute to global food security.
